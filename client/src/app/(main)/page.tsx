      <p>
        Some of the features you will see here are not meant to represent how
        they would typically be used in a real world application. They are
        included purely for demonstration and learning purposes, so you can get
        a sense of the concepts and techniques behind them. Think of this
        project as a sandbox for experimentation. Not every button, flow, or
        feature is optimized for practical use, but each one is designed to
        showcase skills and capabilities. If you were to implement these
        features in a production environment, they would likely look and
        function quite differently.
